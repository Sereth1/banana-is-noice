  '- **To a Friend**: Because nothing says "I appreciate you" quite like a random banana delivery. Bonus points if they’re having a bad day and you can make them laugh!',

  "- **To a Lover**: Want to show your affection in the most a-peel-ing way possible? A banana is sweet, just like your love (and you can totally write a mushy message, too).",
  "- **To a Stranger**: Why not make someone's day, or leave them hilariously confused? Imagine their surprise when they receive a banana out of the blue. It’s an act of random, fruity kindness!",
